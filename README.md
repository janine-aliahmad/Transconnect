# TransConnect

## Project Overview
TransConnect is a transportation management system developed as an assignment for an **Advanced C# course**. The project aims to apply **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles and utilize **classes, data structures, and algorithms** to manage various aspects of a trucking company.

## System Architecture
The system is designed using an OOP approach with a modular architecture:

- **Clients Module:** Stores customer information and manages interactions.
- **Orders Module:** Handles order creation, tracking, and fulfillment.
- **Vehicles Module:** Manages the fleet and assigns vehicles to orders.
- **Employees Module:** Organizes personnel by job roles.
- **Route Optimization Module:** Utilizes **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** for efficient pathfinding in deliveries.


## Algorithms Implemented
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:** Used for finding the shortest delivery routes.
- **Graph and Tree Representations:** For example the employee network is structured using a graph model.
- **OOP Design Patterns:** Implemented for modularity and maintainability.

## Future Improvements
- Implement a **GUI** for better user experience.
- Integrate a **database** for persistent storage.
- Add **real-time tracking** for deliveries.

## License
This project was developed for educational purposes as part of an **Advanced C#** course.
